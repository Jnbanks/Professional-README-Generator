## Installation
The user must have Nodejs and npmjs downloaded on their device. In the VS Code terminal, type: npm install inquirer   ...to get the inquirer dependencies in your folder. Once inquirer is installed you should see node_modules added to your folders, as well as package.json and package-lock.json. Now create another folder called Output. That is where your newly generated README file will go.

## Usage
Type: node index.js     ...into your VS Code terminal and follow the prompts, answering each question to the best of your ability. After the submittal of your last answer a README.md file will be generated and placed in the Output folder.
